#+title: Alegoria
Alegoria is a web front-end to image galleries and collections from several hosting sites. It currently supports TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, among other sites. To add support for the rest of [[https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/blob/master/docs/supportedsites.md][supported sites]], follow the extraction logic in [[file:src/frontend/src/page-schema.ts][page-schema.ts]].

* Installation
** Docker
There's a Docker Compose file available which you can run locally like this:

#+begin_src sh
cd /path/to/alegoria
docker compose up -d
#+end_src

If you'd rather use the image(s) pushed to DockerHub, you can simply remove the =build= section and add an =image= property for the corresponding service in the =docker-compose.yml= file.

#+begin_src yaml
services:
  frontend:
    image: migalmoreno/alegoria-frontend
    # ...
  backend:
    image: migalmoreno/alegoria-backend
    # ...

# ...
#+end_src

* Configuration
You can edit the default gallery-dl [[file:src/frontend/public/config.json][config.json]] file locally with the [[https://gdl-org.github.io/docs/configuration.html][supported configuration options]], such as to change the extractors browser, the included subcategories, the order of posts, and so on.
